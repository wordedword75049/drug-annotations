Patients and Methods The current trial was restricted to patients with nonmetastatic N2b, N2c, or N3 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and fit for taxotere, cisplatin, fluorouracil (TPF). Patients were randomly assigned to receive three cycles of TPF followed by cetux-RT versus concurrent carboplatin fluorouracil and RT as recommended in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The trial was powered to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66 in favor of TPF plus cetux-RT for progression-free survival at 2 years. The inclusion of 180 patients per arm was needed to achieve 80% power at a two-sided significance level of .05. Results Between 2009 and 2013, 370 patients were included. All patients and tumors characteristics were well balanced between arms. There were more cases of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in the induction arm, and the induction TPF was associated with 6.6% treatment-related deaths. With a median follow-up of 2.8 years, 2-year progression-free survival was not different between both arms (CT-RT, 0.38 v TPF + cetux-RT, 0.36; HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.20]; P = .58).

A post-hoc analysis and literature review considered barriers to recruiting patients with melanoma brain metastases to clinical trials.Twenty-four patients were recruited, six to the safety phase and 18 to the randomised phase. The study closed early due to poor recruitment. Median PFS brain was 3.3 months (90% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-5.6) in the vandetanib group and 2.5 months (90% CI: 0.2-4.8) in the placebo group (P=0.34).

The most common barrier to study recruitment was availability of alternative treatments.The combination of WBRT plus vandetanib was well tolerated. Compared with WBRT alone, there was no significant improvement in PFS brain or OS, although we are unable to provide a definitive result due to poor accrual.

We present the final protocol-specified survival analysis.In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 academic institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA). We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to one of two dose regimens of pembrolizumab, or one regimen of ipilimumab, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation schedule. Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Secondary eligibility criteria are described later. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. The primary outcome was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival was assessed every 12 weeks, and final analysis occurred after all patients were followed up for at least 21 months. Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Data cutoff date for this analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319.Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or intravenous ipilimumab every 3 weeks (ipilimumab for four doses; n=278). One patient in the pembrolizumab 2 week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. Median follow-up was 22Â·9 months; 383 patients died. Median overall survival was not reached in either pembrolizumab group and was 16Â·0 months with ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·68, 95% CI 0Â·53-0Â·87 for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0Â·0009 and 0Â·68, 0Â·53-0Â·86 for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0Â·0008). 24-month overall survival rate was 55% in the 2-week group, 55% in the 3-week group, and 43% in the ipilimumab group.Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules. These conclusions further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma.Merck & Co."}

The secondary efficacy parameters included duration of response, duration of stable disease, time to progression/progression-free survival, time to treatment failure and overall survival. The safety analysis included recordings of adverse events and exposure to study treatment. The intention-to-treat population included 37 patients (24 men and 13 women, mean age 54.2Â±13.1 years). Overall response rate was 18.9% (seven patients achieved a response) and clinical benefit was 48.6%. In patients who achieved a response, the median duration of response was 16.9 months and the median duration of stable disease was 12.5 months.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of combined BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib and MEK inhibition with cobimetinib in patients with advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma.We undertook a phase 1b study in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutated melanoma. We included individuals who had either recently progressed on vemurafenib or never received a BRAF inhibitor. In the dose-escalation phase of our study, patients received vemurafenib 720 mg or 960 mg twice a day continuously and cobimetinib 60 mg, 80 mg, or 100 mg once a day for either 14 days on and 14 days off (14/14), 21 days on and 7 days off (21/7), or continuously (28/0). The primary endpoint was safety of the drug combination and to identify dose-limiting toxic effects and the maximum tolerated dose. Efficacy was a key secondary endpoint. All patients treated with vemurafenib and cobimetinib were included in safety and efficacy analyses (intention-to-treat). The study completed accrual and all analyses are final. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01271803.129 patients were treated at ten dosing regimens combining vemurafenib and cobimetinib: 66 had recently progressed on vemurafenib and 63 had never received a BRAF inhibitor. Dose-limiting toxic effects arose in four patients. One patient on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 80 mg once a day 14/14 had grade 3 fatigue for more than 7 days; one patient on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 60 mg once a day 21/7 had a grade 3 prolongation of QTc; and two patients on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 60 mg 28/0 had dose-limiting toxic effects-one developed grade 3 stomatitis and fatigue and one developed arthralgia and myalgia. The maximum tolerated dose was established as vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day in combination with cobimetinib 60 mg 21/7. Across all dosing regimens, the most common adverse events were diarrhoea (83 patients, 64%), non-acneiform rash (77 patients, 60%), liver enzyme abnormalities (64 patients, 50%), fatigue (62 patients, 48%), nausea (58 patients, 45%), and photosensitivity (52 patients, 40%). Most adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (12 patients, 9%; all grade 3), raised amounts of alkaline phosphatase (11 patients, 9%]), and anaemia (nine patients, 7%). Confirmed objective responses were recorded in ten (15%) of 66 patients who had recently progressed on vemurafenib, with a median progression-free survival of 2Â·8 months (95% CI 2Â·6-3Â·4). Confirmed objective responses were noted in 55 (87%) of 63 patients who had never received a BRAF inhibitor, including six (10%) who had a complete response; median progression-free survival was 13Â·7 months (95% CI 10Â·1-17Â·5).The combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was safe and tolerable when administered at the respective maximum tolerated doses. The combination has promising antitumour activity and further clinical development is warranted in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutated melanoma, particularly in those who have never received a BRAF inhibitor; confirmatory clinical testing is ongoing.F Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech."}

In the LGL+ group, clonal TCR-Î³ gene rearrangements were frequently detected at diagnosis (six of nine cases) and persisted during therapy, compared with only two of eight in the LGL- group. The proportion of regulatory T cells to CD4+ T cells at diagnosis was lower in the LGL+ compared with the LGL- group (median 4.2 vs. 6.6 %), and this disparity was sustained throughout the therapeutic period.

This randomised trial assessed whether six or eight cycles of R-CHOP-14 can improve outcome of these patients compared with six or eight cycles of CHOP-14.1222 elderly patients (aged 61-80 years) were randomly assigned to six or eight cycles of CHOP-14 with or without rituximab. Radiotherapy was planned to sites of initial bulky disease with or without extranodal involvement. The primary endpoint was event-free survival; secondary endpoints were response, progression during treatment, progression-free survival, overall survival, and frequency of toxic effects. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered on National Cancer Institute website, number NCT00052936 and as EU-20243.3-year event-free survival was 47.2% after six cycles of CHOP-14 (95% CI 41.2-53.3), 53.0% (47.0-59.1) after eight cycles of CHOP-14, 66.5% (60.9-72.0) after six cycles of R-CHOP-14, and 63.1% (57.4-68.8) after eight cycles of R-CHOP-14.

The primary endpoint was complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA: central Ki67 â‰¤ 2.7%).Results: Fifty patients enrolled. The CCCA rate was significantly higher after adding palbociclib to anastrozole (C1D15 87% vs. C1D1 26%, P < 0.001). Palbociclib enhanced cell-cycle control over anastrozole monotherapy regardless of luminal subtype (A vs. B) and PIK3CA status with activity observed across a broad range of clinicopathologic and mutation profiles. Ki67 recovery at surgery following palbociclib washout was suppressed by cycle 5 palbociclib. Resistance was associated with nonluminal subtypes and persistent E2F-target gene expression.Conclusions: Palbociclib is an active antiproliferative agent for early-stage breast cancer resistant to anastrozole; however, prolonged administration may be necessary to maintain its effect.

Secondary end-points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), safetyÂ and quality of life (QOL).Forty-five patients were enrolled; 43 received the study treatment. The ORR assessed by the IRC was 54.8% (90% confidence interval [CI] 41.0-68.0) and the primary end-point was met. The DCR was 92.9% (95% CI 80.5-98.5). The IRC-assessed median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI 5.4-8.1). The median OS was not reached at the data cutoff. The main treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (76.7%), decreased white blood cell countÂ (27.9%), anaemia (11.6%), decreased appetite (7.0%), febrile neutropenia (4.7%), hypertension (4.7%)Â and proteinuria (4.7%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. No QOL deterioration was observed during study treatment.Nab-paclitaxel plus ramucirumab combination therapy shows promising activity and manageable toxicitiesÂ and could be a useful second-line treatment option for patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer."}

We reported that ipilimumab plus bevacizumab therapy elicited humoral immune responses to galectin-1 (Gal-1), which exhibits protumor, proangiogenesis, and immunosuppressive activities in 37.2% of treated patients. Gal-1 antibodies purified from posttreatment plasma suppressed the binding of Gal-1 to CD45, a T-cell surface receptor that transduces apoptotic signals upon binding to extracellular Gal-1. Antibody responses to Gal-1 were found more frequently in the group of patients with therapeutic responses and correlated with improved overall survival. In contrast, another subgroup of treated patients had increased circulating Gal-1 protein instead, and they had reduced overall survival. Our findings suggest that humoral immunity to Gal-1 may contribute to the efficacy of anti-VEGF and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy.

To improve those results we tested the same chemotherapy protocol in combination with ofatumumab and a pre-phase treatment.For this open-label, multicentre, single-group, phase 2 trial, we recruited patients older than 80 years with untreated histologically-proven CD20-positive DLBCL, Ann Arbor stage I to IV, from 41 academic and hospital centres in France and Belgium. Patients received a pre-phase with oral vincristine (1 mg total dose 1 week before cycle 1 [day -7]) and oral prednisone (60 mg total dose starting 1 week before cycle 1, for 4 days [day -7 to day -4]) before the first cycle of the ofatumumab plus miniCHOP regimen.

This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01195714.Between June 2, 2010, and Nov 4, 2011, we enrolled 120 patients. Age-adjusted International Prognostic Index was 2-3 in 68 (57%) of them. The median follow-up time was 26Â·8 months (IQR 24Â·5-30Â·1). The 2-year overall survival was 64Â·7% (95% CI 55Â·3-72Â·7) and median overall survival was not reached (95% CI 30Â·2-not reached). 45 patients died during the treatment, of whom 28 (62%) died due to lymphoma. The most common side-effect was haematological toxicity. Among the 120 patients, grade 3-4 neutropenia was reported in 24 (21%) patients and thrombocytopenia in two (2%), during the treatment period. Grade 3-4 anaemia was reported in six (5%) patients; seven (6%) patients had one episode of febrile neutropenia. 17 (15%) of 115 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population had red blood cell transfusions and three (3%) had platelet transfusions.Our result suggest that, in patients older than 80 years with DLBCL, ofatumumab and pre-phase treatment seem to improve overall survival compared with the previously reported data. The combination of pre-phase treatment, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, and miniCHOP can be considered a new treatment platform for use in randomised clinical trial design for DLBCL treatment in patients older than 80 years.The Lymphoma Study Association, GlaxoSmithKline."}

A MAGE-A4-specific humoral immune response was observed in four patients who had high expression of MAGE-A4 and MHC class I on tumor cells. These four patients showed significantly longer overall survival than patients without an antibody response after vaccination (p=0.009). Patients with tumor cells expressing high MAGE-A4 or MHC class I antigen showed significantly longer overall survival than those with low expression. Induction of CD4 and CD8T cell responses was observed in three and six patients, respectively, and patients with induction of MAGE-A4-specific IFNÎ³-producing CD8T cells, but not CD4T cells, lived longer than those without induction.The CHP-MAGE-A4 vaccine was safe. Expression of MAGE-A4 and MHC class I in tumor tissue and the induction of a MAGE-A4-specific immune response after vaccination would be feasible prognostic markers for patients vaccinated with MAGE-A4."}

In this study, less clinical benefit of palliative trastuzumab-based therapy was observed in patients relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab compared with no adjuvant trastuzumab treatment. Subgroup analyses and multivariable analyses revealed that this was independent of possible confounding factors, including adjuvant taxane-treatment. This might suggest a clinically meaningful impaired efficacy of trastuzumab after previous, in this case adjuvant, trastuzumab therapy. These results could have implications for treatment decision-making after short progression-free intervals on trastuzumab-containing regimens in the palliative setting."}

The primary endpoints of the study were investigator-assessed safety in all treated patients (the safety population), the maximum tolerated dose, and the pharmacokinetics of umbralisib. Secondary endpoints included preliminary assessments of anti-cancer activity (objective responses and duration of response). Follow-up stopped for a patient once they discontinued therapy. This study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01767766.Between Jan 17, 2013, and Jan 14, 2016, we enrolled and treated 90 patients with umbralisib. The median duration of treatment and follow-up was 4Â·7 cycles (IQR 2Â·0-14Â·0) or 133 days (IQR 55-335). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events irrespective of causality were diarrhoea (in 39 [43%] of 90 patients), nausea (38 [42%]), and fatigue (28 [31%]). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (in 12 [13%] patients), anaemia (eight [9%]) and thrombocytopenia (six [7%]). Serious adverse events considered at least possibly related to umbralisib occurred in seven patients: pneumonia in three (3%) patients, lung infection in one (1%), febrile neutropenia in one (1%), and colitis in two (2%), one of whom also had febrile neutropenia. The maximum tolerated dose was 1200 mg of the micronised formulation, with 800 mg of this formulation selected as the recommended phase 2 dose. Both cases of colitis occurred at above the recommended phase 2 dose. 33 (37%) of the 90 patients enrolled had an objective response to treatment with umbralisib.Umbralisib was well tolerated and showed preliminary signs of activity in patients with relapsed or refractory haematological malignancies. The safety profile of umbralisib in this phase 1 study was distinct from that of other PI3KÎ´ inhibitors, with fewer occurrences of autoimmune-like toxicities such as colitis. These findings warrant further evaluation of this agent in this setting.TG Therapeutics."}

All but 2 patients had received prior therapy with a variety of agents, including 30 with pentostatin; none achieved complete remission (CR). CAMPATH-1H (30 mg) was administered intravenously 3 times weekly until maximal response. The overall response rate was 76% with 60% CR and 16% partial remission (PR). These responses were durable with a median disease-free interval of 7 months (range, 4-45 months). Survival was significantly prolonged in patients achieving CR compared to PR or no response (NR), including one patient who survived 54 months. Nine patients remain alive up to 29 months after completing therapy. Seven patients received high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support, 3 of whom remain alive in CR 5, 7, and 15 months after autograft. Stem cell harvests in these patients were uncontaminated with T-PLL cells as demonstrated by dual-color flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction. Four patients had allogeneic stem cell transplants, 3 from siblings and 1 from a matched unrelated donor. Two had nonmyeloablative conditioning. Three are alive in CR up to 24 months after allograft. The conclusion is that CAMPATH-1H is an effective therapy in T-PLL, producing remissions in more than two thirds of patients.

Predictor models to distinguish, at diagnosis, between patients at high and low risk of progression are needed. The objective of this study was to use gene-expression profiling data to build and validate a predictive model of outcome for patients treated in the rituximab era.A training set of fresh-frozen tumour biopsies was prospectively obtained from 160 untreated patients with high-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma enrolled in the phase 3 randomised PRIMA trial, in which rituximab maintenance was evaluated after rituximab plus chemotherapy induction (median follow-up 6Â·6 years [IQR 6Â·0-7Â·0]). RNA of sufficient quality was obtained for 149 of 160 cases, and Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used for gene-expression profiling. We did a multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify genes with expression levels associated with progression-free survival independently of maintenance treatment in a subgroup of 134 randomised patients. Expression levels from 95 curated genes were then determined by digital expression profiling (NanoString technology) in 53 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of the training set to compare the technical reproducibility of expression levels for each gene between technologies. Genes with high correlation (>0Â·75) were included in an L2-penalised Cox model adjusted on rituximab maintenance to build a predictive score for progression-free survival. The model was validated using NanoString technology to digitally quantify gene expression in 488 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from three independent international patient cohorts from the PRIMA trial (n=178; distinct from the training cohort), the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE project (n=201), and the Barcelona Hospital Clinic (n=109). All tissue samples consisted of pretreatment diagnostic biopsies and were confirmed as follicular lymphoma grade 1-3a. The patients were all treated with regimens containing rituximab and chemotherapy, possibly followed by either rituximab maintenance or ibritumomab-tiuxetan consolidation. We determined an optimum threshold on the score to predict patients at low risk and high risk of progression. The model, including the multigene score and the threshold, was initially evaluated in the three validation cohorts separately. The sensitivity and specificity of the score for the prediction of the risk of lymphoma progression at 2 years were assessed on the combined validation cohorts.In the training cohort, the expression levels of 395 genes were associated with a risk of progression. 23 genes reflecting both B-cell biology and tumour microenvironment with correlation coefficients greater than 0Â·75 between the two technologies and sample types were retained to build a predictive model that identified a population at an increased risk of progression (p<0Â·0001). In a multivariate Cox model for progression-free survival adjusted on rituximab maintenance treatment and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 1 (FLIPI-1) score, this predictor independently predicted progression (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] of the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group 3Â·68, 95% CI 2Â·19-6Â·17 [p<0Â·0001]). The 5-year progression-free survival was 26% (95% CI 16-43) in the high-risk group and 73% (64-83) in the low-risk group. The predictor performances were confirmed in each of the individual validation cohorts (aHR comparing high-risk to low-risk groups 2Â·57 [95% CI 1Â·65-4Â·01] in cohort 1; 2Â·12 [1Â·32-3Â·39] in cohort 2; and 2Â·11 [1Â·01-4Â·41] in cohort 3). In the combined validation cohort, the median progression-free survival was 3Â·1 years (95% CI 2Â·4-4Â·8) in the high-risk group and 10Â·8 years (10Â·1-not reached) in the low-risk group (p<0Â·0001). The risk of lymphoma progression at 2 years was 38% (95% CI 29-46) in the high-risk group and 19% (15-24) in the low-risk group. In a multivariate analysis, the score predicted progression-free survival independently of anti-CD20 maintenance treatment and of the FLIPI score (aHR for the combined cohort 2Â·30, 95% CI 1Â·72-3Â·07).We developed and validated a robust 23-gene expression-based predictor of progression-free survival that is applicable to routinely available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour biopsies from patients with follicular lymphoma at time of diagnosis.

The counts of CEPs and viable CECs below the median value were associated with an improved overall survival: 26.6 vs 9.5 months for CEPs and 22.6 vs 11.0 months for viable CECs, respectively (pÂ =Â 0.02).Oral chemotherapy and bevacizumab (BEVIX) is an active regimen in patients with LBC. We support the importance of using LBC as a biological model for investigating angiogenesis inhibitors. CECs and CEPs biomarkers have been identified as predictive markers of outcome and warrant further investigation."}

We evaluated retrospectively the efficacy and safety of regorafenib and TAS-102 at a single institution between June 2013 and November 2015. Cox regression analysis was carried out to obtain predictive scores (the nearest integers of hazard ratio) for survival benefit. Forty-four patients treated with regorafenib or TAS-102 were included in the analysis; among them, 17 received crossover treatment. The median overall survival (OS) was 9.1 months for regorafenib and 9.3 months for TAS-102, and the corresponding values after crossover were 7.1 and 5.3 months, respectively. OS was not correlated to relative dose intensity, but was proportional to the total administered dose of each drug. Adverse events were tolerable even after crossover. We identified three variables as significant for prediction of OS with good discrimination (C-statistic=0.70): Poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, time since diagnosis of metastatic disease â‰¤18 months, and previous chemotherapy continued â‰¥2 months beyond progression were all predictors of poor OS. Regorafenib and TAS-102 can be recommended for patients with better performance status and slow progression of metastatic disease. Optimal survival benefit was provided by prompt administration of either drug after failure of previous chemotherapy, with flexible titration to the optimal dose for each individual patient."}

Fifty-three patients received individualized therapeutic doses, delivering a specified total-body radiation dose (TBD) based on the clearance rate of a preceding dosimetric dose. Six patients received dosimetric doses only. Dose-escalations of TBD were conducted separately in patients who had or had not undergone a prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) until a nonmyeloablative maximally tolerated TBD was established (non-ASCT = 75 cGy, post-ASCT = 45 cGy). Fourteen additional non-ASCT patients were treated with 75 cGy. Unlabeled antibody was given prior to labeled dosimetric and therapeutic doses to improve biodistribution. Forty-two (71%) of 59 patients responded; 20 (34%) had complete responses (CR). Thirty-five (83%) of 42 with low-grade or transformed NHL responded versus 7 (41%) of 17 with de novo intermediate-grade NHL (P =.005). For all 42 responders, the median progression-free survival was 12 months, 20.3 for those with CR. Seven patients remain in CR 3 to 5.7 years. Sixteen patients were re-treated after progression; 9 responded and 5 had a CR. Reversible hematologic toxicity was dose limiting. Only 10 patients (17%) had human anti-mouse antibodies detected. Long-term, 5 patients developed elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, 5 were diagnosed with myelodysplasia and 3 with solid tumors.

Median progression-free survival was 10Â·7 months (95% CI 5Â·6-14Â·7) in group 1, 2Â·9 months (1Â·2-8Â·3) in group 2; and 2Â·7 months (1Â·8-4Â·2) in group 3. Median overall survival was 19Â·4 months (95% CI 16Â·4-26Â·9) in group 1, 14Â·9 months (8Â·1-24Â·9) in group 2, and 9Â·2 months (4Â·1-14Â·2) in group 3. For the most frequent uncommon mutations, 14 (77Â·8%, 95% CI 52Â·4-93Â·6) patients with Gly719Xaa had an objective response, as did nine (56Â·3%, 29Â·9-80Â·2) with Leu861Gln, and eight (100Â·0%, 63Â·1-100Â·0) with Ser768Ile.Afatinib was active in non-small-cell lung cancer tumours that harboured certain types of uncommon EGFR mutations, especially Gly719Xaa, Leu861Gln, and Ser768Ile, but less active in other mutations types. Clinical benefit was lower in patients with de-novo Thr790Met and exon 20 insertion mutations. These data could help inform clinical decisions for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations.Boehringer Ingelheim."}

The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01582776, and is ongoing but closed to accrual.Between June 11, 2014, and Dec 18, 2015, 89 patients were recruited and 86 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 88 for safety. Median follow-up was 2Â·6 years (IQR 2Â·2-2Â·8). 68 (79%) of 86 evaluable patients (95% CI 69-87) achieved an overall response at induction end, meeting the prespecified primary endpoint.

In the experimental arm, median overall survival was shorter (3.9 vs 6.7 months; HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.90-2.08; Pâ€‰=â€‰.15), as was median progression-free survival (1.9 vs 2.0 months; HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.43; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02). One vs 5 patients had a partial response and 12 vs 14 patients had stable disease in the experimental arm vs mFOLFOX arm. Grade 3 or higher toxic effects were observed in 39 patients treated with selumetinib and MK-2206 vs 23 patients treated with mFOLFOX. More patients in the experimental arm discontinued therapy due to adverse events (13 vs 7 patients).Dual targeting of the MEK and PI3K/AKT pathways downstream of KRAS by selumetinib plus MK-2206 did not improve overall survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma for whom gemcitabine-based chemotherapy had failed. This was the first randomized prospective evaluation of mFOLFOX in the US population that showed comparable results to CONKO-003 and PANCREOX.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01658943."}

Post-treatment levels of sTNF-R2 peaked significantly higher than sTNF-R1 (P<0.0001). Changes in sTNF-Rs, however, did not differ across dose levels, suggesting a plateau effect in shedding kinetics.

Patients received 2-h infusions of GO twice with an interval of approximately 14 days. Tolerability was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0. Samples for pharmacokinetics were taken on day 1 and day 8 of the first treatment cycle. The dose was increased stepwise and, in each cohort, patients were treated at the same dose. Forty patients, median age 58 years (range 28-68) were treated; 20 and 20 patients were enrolled to the phase I and II parts, respectively. In the phase I part, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were hepatotoxicities, and the recommended dose was established as 9 mg/m2 given as two intravenous infusions separated by approximately 14 days. The pharmacokinetic study revealed that Cmax and AUC were equivalent to those of non-Japanese patients. In the phase II part, complete remission was observed in 5 patients, and one patient had complete remission without platelet recovery. Four of these 6 in remission and one in the phase I are long-term survivors (alive for at least 44 months). GO is safe and effective as a single agent among Japanese CD33-positive AML patients. Remission lasted longer in a subset of patients than in non-Japanese patients in earlier studies. Further studies of this agent are warranted to establish standard therapy."},

Intensive therapeutic regimens result in high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival but at the expense of significant toxicity. We report here our results of the administration of rituximab plus chlorambucil (R-Chl) as first line treatment in patients with MCL. Twenty consecutively diagnosed patients were treated with this combination in which an induction and a maintenance arm were included. During induction, rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) on day 1, while chlorambucil was given afterward at a dose of 10 mg/day for 10 consecutive days for eight cycles and then as a single agent for an additional four cycles. Maintenance consisted of rituximab administration every 2 months for 1 year. Most patients had indolent disease features such as a low mantle-cell international prognostic index (MIPI) score. The overall response rate was 95% (90% CR, 5% PR). Among patients in CR, 78% presented a molecular remission. The 3-year progression-free survival was 89%. There were no serious side effects. These results show that the R-Chl combination could be an effective therapeutic option as first line treatment in MCL, especially for patients with indolent disease characteristics."},

Moreover, serum levels of bone-formation markers (bone-specific ALP and osteocalcin) significantly increased in 5 and 2 responsive patients, respectively. Radiographic examination showed improvement in bone lesions, suggesting that BD therapy induces osteoblast activation in responders. Adverse events included thrombocytopenia of grades 1 to 3, peripheral neuropathy of grades 1 to 2, and grade 3 ileus and were transient and manageable.

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients are often treated with sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Sunitinibs anti-cancer effect is at least partly mediated through interfering with angiogenesis. Our aim with the current study was to assess annexin A1 (ANXA1), which stimulates angiogenesis, as a predictive marker for sunitinib therapy in mRCC patients. Since previous studies have indicated a predictive potential for cubilin, we also investigated the predictivity of ANXA1 combined with cubilin. Methods: ANXA1 expression was analysed in tumor tissue from a cohort of patients with advanced RCC (n=139) using immunohistochemistry. Ninety-nine of the patients were treated with sunitinib in the first or second-line setting. Twenty-two of these were censored because of toxicity leading to the termination of treatment and the remaining (n=77) were selected for the present study. Results: Twenty-five (32%) out of seventy-seven of the tumors lacked ANXA1 in the cytoplasm. On statistical analyses using Kaplan-Meier method, aNXA1 negative tumors were significantly associated with a longer treatment benefit in terms of progression free survival (PFS). Overall survival was also significantly better for patients with ANXA1 negative tumors. The combined ANXA1 positive and cubilin negative expression could more accurately than ANXA1 alone define the group not benefitting from treatment. Conclusions: Our results indicate that cytoplasmic expression of ANXA1 is a negative predictive marker for sunitinib therapy in mRCC patients. A possible explanation for this finding is that sunitinibs anti-angiogenic effect cannot overcome the pro-angiogenic drive from many ANXA1 proteins."},

Fifty-two patients were assessable for response and all 61 patients were assessable for survival. Seventeen (33%) of 52 patients experienced a minor/partial response to single-agent trastuzumab and received 8 additional weeks of single-agent trastuzumab. Fifteen (29%) of 52 patients had stable disease and proceeded to receive paclitaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab. Thirty-one patients with measurable disease were assessable for response after initial single-agent trastuzumab followed by paclitaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab. An overall response rate of 84% (eight complete responses/18 partial responses), median time to progression of 14.2 months, and median overall survival of 32.2 months was reported with the triplet combination. In the patients treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin alone after disease progression on initial single-agent trastuzumab, an overall response rate of 69% (one complete response/10 partial responses), median time to progression of 8.3 months, and median overall survival of 22.2 months was reported. Median time to progression for all 61 patients is 10 months and the median overall survival is 26.7 months.This trial confirms the activity and tolerability of weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin alone or in combination with trastuzumab in women with HER-2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer."},

The median age of the 14 patients (11 males, 3 females) was 68 years (32-77). The median progression-free survival (PFS) following prior cetuximab-based therapy was 6.6 months (range, 4.1-18.4). Initial cetuximab treatment was administered as a first-line treatment in 11 patients, a second-line treatment in 1 patient and a third-line treatment in 2 patients. The median interval time between the last cycle of initial cetuximab-based therapy and the first cycle of cetuximab retreatment was 13.1 months (range, 6.0-37.1). The objective response rate of cetuximab retreatment was 21.4% and the median PFS was 4.4 months (95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.6). The Spearman's correlation coefficient for the PFS following retreatment and duration of initial cetuximab-based regimens demonstrated a more marked correlation compared with that between the PFS following retreatment and the interval time between the two regimens (r=0.45, P=0.11 vs. r=0.08, P=0.79). Cetuximab retreatment may provide clinical benefit to patients with mCRC who were good responders with longer periods of initial cetuximab-based therapy."},

Current recommendations for incurable disease consist of a platinum-based regimen with fluorouracil and cetuximab. Studied in patients with PS of 0 to 1, the fluorouracil-based regimens were associated with significant toxicities. Therefore, weekly PCC may offer an appealing, less toxic alternative for incurable patients with poor PS.

Of the 41 patients evaluated, baseline PS ranged as follows: PS of 2 (41Â %), PS of 1 (54Â %), and PS of 0 (5Â %). Patients received 2 to 6 cycles, averaging 4 cycles. Thirty-one patients (76Â %) required treatment to be held, delayed or dose reduced, most commonly for hematologic toxicities.

Vomiting and abdominal pain, skin reaction tachycardia and hypotension appeared in two patients at level 5. At 7.5 mg, we observed a severe grade 3 reaction with hypotension, dyspnea and grade 4 myalgia. This was considered the dose-limiting toxicity. Eleven patients (seven with melanoma and four with other tumors) were treated to evaluate anticancer effects at the maximum tolerated dose (5 mg). Only one patient reported a minor response, lasting eight weeks. Ten patients reported progressive disease.CRM197, injected subcutaneously at 5 mg, elicited a generic inflammatory response causing toxicity, and did not exert a significant degree of antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma and solid tumour."},

In preclinical models tumour-derived VEGF limits immune cell activity while anti-VEGF augments intra-tumoral T-cell infiltration, potentially through vascular normalization and endothelial cell activation. This study investigates how VEGF blockade with bevacizumab could potentiate PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition with atezolizumab in mRCC. Tissue collections are before treatment, after bevacizumab and after the addition of atezolizumab. We discover that intra-tumoral CD8(+) T cells increase following combination treatment. A related increase is found in intra-tumoral MHC-I, Th1 and T-effector markers, and chemokines, most notably CX3CL1 (fractalkine). We also discover that the fractalkine receptor increases on peripheral CD8(+) T cells with treatment. Furthermore, trafficking lymphocyte increases are observed in tumors following bevacizumab and combination treatment. These data suggest that the anti-VEGF and anti-PD-L1 combination improves antigen-specific T-cell migration."},

Median PFS and OS in the EGFR 2+/3+ subgroups were 118.5/59.0 and 358.5/229.5 days, respectively. The RR was 33.3/0.0 % in the N-IRI/IRI treatment group. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 77.5/64.3 %. No adverse events of grade 3 or higher skin rash or grade 3 or higher infusion-related reaction were reported.There was no superiority of N-IRI over IRI alone in terms of PFS in 5-fluorouracil-refractory AGC patients. However, N-IRI showed potential improvement in the EGFR 2+/3+ subgroup based on improved RR, PFS, and OS."}
