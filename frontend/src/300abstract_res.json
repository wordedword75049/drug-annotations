Patients and Methods The current trial was restricted to patients with nonmetastatic N2b, N2c, or N3 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and fit for taxotere, cisplatin, fluorouracil (TPF). Patients were randomly assigned to receive three cycles of TPF followed by cetux-RT versus concurrent carboplatin fluorouracil and RT as recommended in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The trial was powered to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66 in favor of TPF plus cetux-RT for progression-free survival at 2 years. The inclusion of 180 patients per arm was needed to achieve 80% power at a two-sided significance level of .05. Results Between 2009 and 2013, 370 patients were included. All patients and tumors characteristics were well balanced between arms. There were more cases of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in the induction arm, and the induction TPF was associated with 6.6% treatment-related deaths. With a median follow-up of 2.8 years, 2-year progression-free survival was not different between both arms (CT-RT, 0.38 v TPF + cetux-RT, 0.36; HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.20]; P = .58).

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in brain (PFS brain). The main study was preceded by a safety run-in phase to confirm tolerability of the combination. A post-hoc analysis and literature review considered barriers to recruiting patients with melanoma brain metastases to clinical trials.Twenty-four patients were recruited, six to the safety phase and 18 to the randomised phase. The study closed early due to poor recruitment. Median PFS brain was 3.3 months (90% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-5.6) in the vandetanib group and 2.5 months (90% CI: 0.2-4.8) in the placebo group (P=0.34).

The most common barrier to study recruitment was availability of alternative treatments.The combination of WBRT plus vandetanib was well tolerated. Compared with WBRT alone, there was no significant improvement in PFS brain or OS, although we are unable to provide a definitive result due to poor accrual.

We present the final protocol-specified survival analysis.In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 academic institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA). We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to one of two dose regimens of pembrolizumab, or one regimen of ipilimumab, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation schedule. Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Secondary eligibility criteria are described later. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. The primary outcome was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival was assessed every 12 weeks, and final analysis occurred after all patients were followed up for at least 21 months. Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Data cutoff date for this analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319.Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or intravenous ipilimumab every 3 weeks (ipilimumab for four doses; n=278). One patient in the pembrolizumab 2 week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. Median follow-up was 22·9 months; 383 patients died. Median overall survival was not reached in either pembrolizumab group and was 16·0 months with ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0·68, 95% CI 0·53-0·87 for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0·0009 and 0·68, 0·53-0·86 for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0·0008). 24-month overall survival rate was 55% in the 2-week group, 55% in the 3-week group, and 43% in the ipilimumab group.Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules.

This prospective, open-label, phase II study included patients with previously untreated MM or unresectable melanoma. Patients received dacarbazine and bevacizumab until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy variable was the overall response rate. The secondary efficacy parameters included duration of response, duration of stable disease, time to progression/progression-free survival, time to treatment failure and overall survival. The safety analysis included recordings of adverse events and exposure to study treatment. The intention-to-treat population included 37 patients (24 men and 13 women, mean age 54.2±13.1 years). Overall response rate was 18.9% (seven patients achieved a response) and clinical benefit was 48.6%. In patients who achieved a response, the median duration of response was 16.9 months and the median duration of stable disease was 12.5 months.

Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older who had experienced progressive disease during or after one previous platinum-based regimen. Initially, patients were randomly assigned to receive either pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and then randomly assigned within each group to receive their chemotherapy with or without cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) at first dose and 250 mg/m(2) weekly thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of combined BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib and MEK inhibition with cobimetinib in patients with advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma.We undertook a phase 1b study in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutated melanoma. We included individuals who had either recently progressed on vemurafenib or never received a BRAF inhibitor. In the dose-escalation phase of our study, patients received vemurafenib 720 mg or 960 mg twice a day continuously and cobimetinib 60 mg, 80 mg, or 100 mg once a day for either 14 days on and 14 days off (14/14), 21 days on and 7 days off (21/7), or continuously (28/0). The primary endpoint was safety of the drug combination and to identify dose-limiting toxic effects and the maximum tolerated dose. Efficacy was a key secondary endpoint. All patients treated with vemurafenib and cobimetinib were included in safety and efficacy analyses (intention-to-treat). The study completed accrual and all analyses are final. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01271803.129 patients were treated at ten dosing regimens combining vemurafenib and cobimetinib: 66 had recently progressed on vemurafenib and 63 had never received a BRAF inhibitor. Dose-limiting toxic effects arose in four patients. One patient on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 80 mg once a day 14/14 had grade 3 fatigue for more than 7 days; one patient on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 60 mg once a day 21/7 had a grade 3 prolongation of QTc; and two patients on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 60 mg 28/0 had dose-limiting toxic effects-one developed grade 3 stomatitis and fatigue and one developed arthralgia and myalgia. The maximum tolerated dose was established as vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day in combination with cobimetinib 60 mg 21/7. Across all dosing regimens, the most common adverse events were diarrhoea (83 patients, 64%), non-acneiform rash (77 patients, 60%), liver enzyme abnormalities (64 patients, 50%), fatigue (62 patients, 48%), nausea (58 patients, 45%), and photosensitivity (52 patients, 40%). Most adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (12 patients, 9%; all grade 3), raised amounts of alkaline phosphatase (11 patients, 9%]), and anaemia (nine patients, 7%). Confirmed objective responses were recorded in ten (15%) of 66 patients who had recently progressed on vemurafenib, with a median progression-free survival of 2·8 months (95% CI 2·6-3·4). Confirmed objective responses were noted in 55 (87%) of 63 patients who had never received a BRAF inhibitor, including six (10%) who had a complete response; median progression-free survival was 13·7 months (95% CI 10·1-17·5).The combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was safe and tolerable when administered at the respective maximum tolerated doses. The combination has promising antitumour activity and further clinical development is warranted in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutated melanoma, particularly in those who have never received a BRAF inhibitor; confirmatory clinical testing is ongoing.F Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech."}

The proportion of regulatory T cells to CD4+ T cells at diagnosis was lower in the LGL+ compared with the LGL- group (median 4.2 vs. 6.6 %), and this disparity was sustained throughout the therapeutic period.

This randomised trial assessed whether six or eight cycles of R-CHOP-14 can improve outcome of these patients compared with six or eight cycles of CHOP-14.1222 elderly patients (aged 61-80 years) were randomly assigned to six or eight cycles of CHOP-14 with or without rituximab. Radiotherapy was planned to sites of initial bulky disease with or without extranodal involvement. The primary endpoint was event-free survival; secondary endpoints were response, progression during treatment, progression-free survival, overall survival, and frequency of toxic effects. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered on National Cancer Institute website, number NCT00052936 and as EU-20243.3-year event-free survival was 47.2% after six cycles of CHOP-14 (95% CI 41.2-53.3), 53.0% (47.0-59.1) after eight cycles of CHOP-14, 66.5% (60.9-72.0) after six cycles of R-CHOP-14, and 63.1% (57.4-68.8) after eight cycles of R-CHOP-14.

Serial biopsies at baseline, C1D1, C1D15, and surgery were analyzed for Ki67, gene expression, and mutation profiles. The primary endpoint was complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA: central Ki67 ≤ 2.7%).Results: Fifty patients enrolled. The CCCA rate was significantly higher after adding palbociclib to anastrozole (C1D15 87% vs. C1D1 26%, P < 0.001). Palbociclib enhanced cell-cycle control over anastrozole monotherapy regardless of luminal subtype (A vs. B) and PIK3CA status with activity observed across a broad range of clinicopathologic and mutation profiles. Ki67 recovery at surgery following palbociclib washout was suppressed by cycle 5 palbociclib. Resistance was associated with nonluminal subtypes and persistent E2F-target gene expression.Conclusions: Palbociclib is an active antiproliferative agent for early-stage breast cancer resistant to anastrozole; however, prolonged administration may be necessary to maintain its effect.

The ORR assessed by the IRC was 54.8% (90% confidence interval [CI] 41.0-68.0) and the primary end-point was met. The DCR was 92.9% (95% CI 80.5-98.5). The IRC-assessed median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI 5.4-8.1). The median OS was not reached at the data cutoff. The main treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (76.7%), decreased white blood cell count (27.9%), anaemia (11.6%), decreased appetite (7.0%), febrile neutropenia (4.7%), hypertension (4.7%) and proteinuria (4.7%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. No QOL deterioration was observed during study treatment.Nab-paclitaxel plus ramucirumab combination therapy shows promising activity and manageable toxicities and could be a useful second-line treatment option for patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer."}

We reported that ipilimumab plus bevacizumab therapy elicited humoral immune responses to galectin-1 (Gal-1), which exhibits protumor, proangiogenesis, and immunosuppressive activities in 37.2% of treated patients. Gal-1 antibodies purified from posttreatment plasma suppressed the binding of Gal-1 to CD45, a T-cell surface receptor that transduces apoptotic signals upon binding to extracellular Gal-1. Antibody responses to Gal-1 were found more frequently in the group of patients with therapeutic responses and correlated with improved overall survival. In contrast, another subgroup of treated patients had increased circulating Gal-1 protein instead, and they had reduced overall survival. Our findings suggest that humoral immunity to Gal-1 may contribute to the efficacy of anti-VEGF and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy.

Median PFS was 5.3 (3.5,9.7) months, stable disease was seen in 5/17 patients (29%), and median OS was 11.7 (7.5-13.6) months. Grade 3 toxicities included hypertension (29%), hyponatremia (29%), and hyperbilirubinemia (18%). Cediranib PK were comparable to those seen in cancer patients with normal hepatic function. Plasma levels of VEGF and PlGF increased and sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2, and Ang-2 decreased after cediranib treatment. PFS was inversely correlated with baseline levels of VEGF, sVEGFR2, and bFGF and with on-treatment levels of bFGF and IGF-1, and directly associated with on-treatment levels of IFN-γ. OS was inversely correlated with baseline levels of sVEGFR1, Ang-2, TNF-α, CAIX, and CD34(+)CD133(+)CD45(dim) circulating progenitor cells and on-treatment levels of sVEGFR2.Despite the limitations of primary endpoint selection, cediranib at 30-mg daily showed a high incidence of toxicity and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in advanced HCC. Hepatic dysfunction did not seem to affect the steady-state PK of cediranib. Exploratory studies suggested proangiogenic and inflammatory factors as potential biomarkers of anti-VEGF therapy in HCC."}

Two patients on 10 mg/kg had partial response, and one on 3 mg/kg had stable disease. One patient had durable partial response at 3 years without further treatment, at time of this report. There was one grade 3/4 immune-mediated adverse reaction with 3 mg/kg and five with 10 mg/kg. There were no treatment-related deaths. The study was stopped due to slow accrual.At >1 year follow-up, ipilimumab demonstrated activity in melanoma patients aged 12 to <18 years, with a similar safety profile as that seen in adults. Our trial highlights the difficulties of enrolling younger patients with rare diseases in clinical trials for treatments that are approved in adults, suggesting adolescents with cancer types occurring predominantly in adults should be considered for inclusion in adult trials of promising new drugs.NCT01696045."}

To improve those results we tested the same chemotherapy protocol in combination with ofatumumab and a pre-phase treatment.For this open-label, multicentre, single-group, phase 2 trial, we recruited patients older than 80 years with untreated histologically-proven CD20-positive DLBCL, Ann Arbor stage I to IV, from 41 academic and hospital centres in France and Belgium. Patients received a pre-phase with oral vincristine (1 mg total dose 1 week before cycle 1 [day -7]) and oral prednisone (60 mg total dose starting 1 week before cycle 1, for 4 days [day -7 to day -4]) before the first cycle of the ofatumumab plus miniCHOP regimen.

This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01195714.Between June 2, 2010, and Nov 4, 2011, we enrolled 120 patients. Age-adjusted International Prognostic Index was 2-3 in 68 (57%) of them. The median follow-up time was 26·8 months (IQR 24·5-30·1). The 2-year overall survival was 64·7% (95% CI 55·3-72·7) and median overall survival was not reached (95% CI 30·2-not reached). 45 patients died during the treatment, of whom 28 (62%) died due to lymphoma. The most common side-effect was haematological toxicity. Among the 120 patients, grade 3-4 neutropenia was reported in 24 (21%) patients and thrombocytopenia in two (2%), during the treatment period. Grade 3-4 anaemia was reported in six (5%) patients; seven (6%) patients had one episode of febrile neutropenia. 17 (15%) of 115 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population had red blood cell transfusions and three (3%) had platelet transfusions.Our result suggest that, in patients older than 80 years with DLBCL, ofatumumab and pre-phase treatment seem to improve overall survival compared with the previously reported data. The combination of pre-phase treatment, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, and miniCHOP can be considered a new treatment platform for use in randomised clinical trial design for DLBCL treatment in patients older than 80 years.The Lymphoma Study Association, GlaxoSmithKline."}

The incidence rates of leukopenia and liver function damage of grades 3-4 were higher in the combination group than in the icotinib only group (12.2% vs. 0%, χ2 = 11.086, P = 0.001; 12.2% vs. 3.5%, χ2 = 4.488, P = 0.034). However, adverse events were resolved in most patients.Use of the combination of icotinib and chemotherapy as first-line therapy significantly improved the PFS of advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with sensitive EGFR mutations. Although the combination therapy increased the incidence of leukopenia and liver function damage, the observed adverse events were tolerable and manageable."}

Analyses of several patient subgroups showed improvements in median OS: TSFLT <6 months, 9.5 versus 7.5 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.98); chemorefractory to FLT, 9.1 versus 6.9 months (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99); progressive disease (PD) as best response to FLT, 9.8 versus 6.3 months (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.94); TEFLT ≤6 months, 11.3 versus 8.2 months (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.92); and TEFLT <3 months, 11.0 versus 8.0 months (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.94).Nintedanib/docetaxel demonstrated significant OS benefits in adenocarcinoma patients, which were more pronounced in patients with shorter TSFLT or TEFLT, or with PD as best response to FLT.

No adverse events led to discontinuation of therapy. In multivariate analysis, time from androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to castration resistance of ≤18 months was a determinant of shorter OS (P = 0.007).These results support the favourable safety and efficacy profile of AA for the treatment of Asian patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC.

Serious adverse events were similar between groups (112 [43%] of 258 patients in the ramucirumab group vs 107 [40%] of 265 patients in the placebo group). Adverse events related to study treatment and leading to death occurred in eight (3%) patients in the ramucirumab group versus five (2%) patients in the placebo group.Additional follow-up supports that ramucirumab plus docetaxel significantly improves progression-free survival, without a significant improvement in overall survival, for patients with platinum-refractory advanced urothelial carcinoma.

This study investigates the outcome (overall survival [OS] and time to next treatment [TNT]) in MBC patients pretreated with trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting (TP-group) compared with trastuzumab-naïve patients (TN-group) in order to investigate the possibility of trastuzumab resistance.Patients treated with first-line HER2-targeted-containing chemotherapy were eligible for the study. A power analysis was performed to estimate the minimum size of the TP-group. OS and TNT were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.Between January 1, 2000, and June 1, 2014, 469 patients were included, of whom 82 were in the TP-group and 387 were in the TN-group. Median OS and TNT were significantly worse in the TP-group compared with the TN-group (17 vs. 30 months, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.84 [1.15-2.96], p = .01 and 7 vs. 13 months, adjusted HR 1.65 [1.06-2.58], p = .03) after adjustment for age, year of diagnosis, disease-free interval, hormone receptor status, metastatic site, and cytotoxic regimens.First-line trastuzumab-containing treatment regimens are less effective in patients with failure of adjuvant trastuzumab compared with trastuzumab-naïve patients and might be due to trastuzumab resistance. The impact of trastuzumab resistance on the response on dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab and how resistance mechanisms can be used in the optimization of HER2-targeted treatment lines need further investigation.Evidence on the efficacy of palliative trastuzumab-based therapy after failure of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting is limited because of a minority of patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab in clinical trials. In this study, less clinical benefit of palliative trastuzumab-based therapy was observed in patients relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab compared with no adjuvant trastuzumab treatment. Subgroup analyses and multivariable analyses revealed that this was independent of possible confounding factors, including adjuvant taxane-treatment. This might suggest a clinically meaningful impaired efficacy of trastuzumab after previous, in this case adjuvant, trastuzumab therapy. These results could have implications for treatment decision-making after short progression-free intervals on trastuzumab-containing regimens in the palliative setting."}

Local pathological review was performed to confirm diagnosis. Response was assessed by RECIST1.1. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were computed by Kaplan-Meier method.Seventy-two patients were included (66 anthracycline-based regimens; 26 gemcitabine-based regimens; 12 pazopanib). In the anthracycline-based group, 24 (36%) patients were treated for localized disease, and 42 (64%) patients were treated for advanced disease. The real-world overall response rate (rwORR) was 38%. For patients with localized disease, the median RFS was 14.6 months. For patients with advanced disease, the median PFS was 7.7 months. No anthracycline-related cardiac toxicity was reported in patients with cardiac InS (n = 26). For gemcitabine and pazopanib, the rwORR was 8%, and the median PFS was 3.2 and 3.7 months, respectively.This retrospective series shows the activity of anthracycline-based regimens in InS. Of note, anthracyclines were used in patients with cardiac InS with no significant cardiac toxicity. The prognosis in patients with InS remains poor, and new active drugs and treatment strategies are needed."}

Gene expression data from the NOAH trial were used for validation.TIL as continuous variable and PDL1 protein expression were not significantly associated with pCRB. Expression of immune genes/metagenes had different association with pCRB after THP than after other therapies. With THP, higher expression of PD1 and STAT1, or any among PDL1, CTLA4, MHC1, and IF-I were linked with lower pCRB. In the combined TH/TP/HP treatment group, in multivariate analysis, higher expression of PD1, MHC2, and STAT1 were linked with pCRB, and higher PDL1, MHC1, or IF-I to lower pCRB.

Umbralisib also uniquely inhibits casein kinase-1ε, a major regulator of protein translation. The aim of this first-in-human phase 1 study was to establish the safety and preliminary activity profile of umbralisib in patients with haematological malignancies.We did an open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation study at seven clinics in the USA. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or Hodgkin's lymphoma, who had received one or more previous lines of therapy, with measurable and assessable disease, and adequate organ system function. Patients self-administered an umbralisib oral tablet once per day in 28-day cycles, with dose escalation done in a traditional 3 + 3 design to establish safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose. In initial cohorts, patients took umbralisib in a fasting state at a starting dose of 50 mg, increasing to 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200, and 1800 mg until the maximum tolerated dose was reached, or the maximal dose cohort was accrued without a dose-limiting toxicity.

In August, 2014, all patients still on study were transitioned to 800 mg of the micronised formulation and dosing of the initial formulation was discontinued. The primary endpoints of the study were investigator-assessed safety in all treated patients (the safety population), the maximum tolerated dose, and the pharmacokinetics of umbralisib. Secondary endpoints included preliminary assessments of anti-cancer activity (objective responses and duration of response). Follow-up stopped for a patient once they discontinued therapy. This study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01767766.Between Jan 17, 2013, and Jan 14, 2016, we enrolled and treated 90 patients with umbralisib. The median duration of treatment and follow-up was 4·7 cycles (IQR 2·0-14·0) or 133 days (IQR 55-335). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events irrespective of causality were diarrhoea (in 39 [43%] of 90 patients), nausea (38 [42%]), and fatigue (28 [31%]). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (in 12 [13%] patients), anaemia (eight [9%]) and thrombocytopenia (six [7%]). Serious adverse events considered at least possibly related to umbralisib occurred in seven patients: pneumonia in three (3%) patients, lung infection in one (1%), febrile neutropenia in one (1%), and colitis in two (2%), one of whom also had febrile neutropenia. The maximum tolerated dose was 1200 mg of the micronised formulation, with 800 mg of this formulation selected as the recommended phase 2 dose. Both cases of colitis occurred at above the recommended phase 2 dose. 33 (37%) of the 90 patients enrolled had an objective response to treatment with umbralisib.Umbralisib was well tolerated and showed preliminary signs of activity in patients with relapsed or refractory haematological malignancies. The safety profile of umbralisib in this phase 1 study was distinct from that of other PI3Kδ inhibitors, with fewer occurrences of autoimmune-like toxicities such as colitis. These findings warrant further evaluation of this agent in this setting.TG Therapeutics."}

Preliminary results indicated a high remission induction rate with the human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H. This study reports results in 39 patients with T-PLL treated with CAMPATH-1H between March 1993 and May 2000. All but 2 patients had received prior therapy with a variety of agents, including 30 with pentostatin; none achieved complete remission (CR). CAMPATH-1H (30 mg) was administered intravenously 3 times weekly until maximal response. The overall response rate was 76% with 60% CR and 16% partial remission (PR). These responses were durable with a median disease-free interval of 7 months (range, 4-45 months). Survival was significantly prolonged in patients achieving CR compared to PR or no response (NR), including one patient who survived 54 months. Nine patients remain alive up to 29 months after completing therapy. Seven patients received high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support, 3 of whom remain alive in CR 5, 7, and 15 months after autograft. Stem cell harvests in these patients were uncontaminated with T-PLL cells as demonstrated by dual-color flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction. Four patients had allogeneic stem cell transplants, 3 from siblings and 1 from a matched unrelated donor. Two had nonmyeloablative conditioning. Three are alive in CR up to 24 months after allograft. The conclusion is that CAMPATH-1H is an effective therapy in T-PLL, producing remissions in more than two thirds of patients. The use of stem cell transplantation to consolidate responses merits further study."},

Lenalidomide alone was associated with more treatment failures, with 22% of patients discontinuing treatment as a result of adverse events. Dose-intensity exceeded 80% in both arms. Overall response rate was 53% (20% complete response) and 76% (39% complete response) for lenalidomide alone and LR, respectively (P = .029). At the median follow-up of 2.5 years, median time to progression was 1.1 year for lenalidomide alone and 2 years for LR (P = .0023).LR is more active than lenalidomide alone in recurrent FL with similar toxicity, warranting further study in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as a platform for addition of novel agents."}

Predictor models to distinguish, at diagnosis, between patients at high and low risk of progression are needed. The objective of this study was to use gene-expression profiling data to build and validate a predictive model of outcome for patients treated in the rituximab era.A training set of fresh-frozen tumour biopsies was prospectively obtained from 160 untreated patients with high-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma enrolled in the phase 3 randomised PRIMA trial, in which rituximab maintenance was evaluated after rituximab plus chemotherapy induction (median follow-up 6·6 years [IQR 6·0-7·0]). RNA of sufficient quality was obtained for 149 of 160 cases, and Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used for gene-expression profiling. We did a multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify genes with expression levels associated with progression-free survival independently of maintenance treatment in a subgroup of 134 randomised patients. Expression levels from 95 curated genes were then determined by digital expression profiling (NanoString technology) in 53 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of the training set to compare the technical reproducibility of expression levels for each gene between technologies. Genes with high correlation (>0·75) were included in an L2-penalised Cox model adjusted on rituximab maintenance to build a predictive score for progression-free survival. The model was validated using NanoString technology to digitally quantify gene expression in 488 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from three independent international patient cohorts from the PRIMA trial (n=178; distinct from the training cohort), the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE project (n=201), and the Barcelona Hospital Clinic (n=109). All tissue samples consisted of pretreatment diagnostic biopsies and were confirmed as follicular lymphoma grade 1-3a. The patients were all treated with regimens containing rituximab and chemotherapy, possibly followed by either rituximab maintenance or ibritumomab-tiuxetan consolidation. We determined an optimum threshold on the score to predict patients at low risk and high risk of progression. The model, including the multigene score and the threshold, was initially evaluated in the three validation cohorts separately. The sensitivity and specificity of the score for the prediction of the risk of lymphoma progression at 2 years were assessed on the combined validation cohorts.In the training cohort, the expression levels of 395 genes were associated with a risk of progression. 23 genes reflecting both B-cell biology and tumour microenvironment with correlation coefficients greater than 0·75 between the two technologies and sample types were retained to build a predictive model that identified a population at an increased risk of progression (p<0·0001). In a multivariate Cox model for progression-free survival adjusted on rituximab maintenance treatment and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 1 (FLIPI-1) score, this predictor independently predicted progression (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] of the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group 3·68, 95% CI 2·19-6·17 [p<0·0001]). The 5-year progression-free survival was 26% (95% CI 16-43) in the high-risk group and 73% (64-83) in the low-risk group. The predictor performances were confirmed in each of the individual validation cohorts (aHR comparing high-risk to low-risk groups 2·57 [95% CI 1·65-4·01] in cohort 1; 2·12 [1·32-3·39] in cohort 2; and 2·11 [1·01-4·41] in cohort 3). In the combined validation cohort, the median progression-free survival was 3·1 years (95% CI 2·4-4·8) in the high-risk group and 10·8 years (10·1-not reached) in the low-risk group (p<0·0001). The risk of lymphoma progression at 2 years was 38% (95% CI 29-46) in the high-risk group and 19% (15-24) in the low-risk group. In a multivariate analysis, the score predicted progression-free survival independently of anti-CD20 maintenance treatment and of the FLIPI score (aHR for the combined cohort 2·30, 95% CI 1·72-3·07).We developed and validated a robust 23-gene expression-based predictor of progression-free survival that is applicable to routinely available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour biopsies from patients with follicular lymphoma at time of diagnosis.

Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was more common in Arm B (60 %) than Arms A (16 %) or C (22 %); other adverse events were similar. The investigator-assessed ORR was 48, 71, and 63 % for Arms A, B, and C, respectively. Median progression-free survival (randomized patients) was 9.6 months in Arm A, 11.9 months in Arm B, and 13.5 months in Arm C. In conclusion, ixabepilone Q3W plus bevacizumab has clinical activity as first-line therapy for MBC relative to paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, but with significantly greater risk of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. In addition, these data suggest that weekly dosing of ixabepilone may be less active than Q3W dosing, but with less neutropenia."}

We evaluated retrospectively the efficacy and safety of regorafenib and TAS-102 at a single institution between June 2013 and November 2015. Cox regression analysis was carried out to obtain predictive scores (the nearest integers of hazard ratio) for survival benefit. Forty-four patients treated with regorafenib or TAS-102 were included in the analysis; among them, 17 received crossover treatment. The median overall survival (OS) was 9.1 months for regorafenib and 9.3 months for TAS-102, and the corresponding values after crossover were 7.1 and 5.3 months, respectively. OS was not correlated to relative dose intensity, but was proportional to the total administered dose of each drug. Adverse events were tolerable even after crossover. We identified three variables as significant for prediction of OS with good discrimination (C-statistic=0.70): Poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, time since diagnosis of metastatic disease ≤18 months, and previous chemotherapy continued ≥2 months beyond progression were all predictors of poor OS. Regorafenib and TAS-102 can be recommended for patients with better performance status and slow progression of metastatic disease. Optimal survival benefit was provided by prompt administration of either drug after failure of previous chemotherapy, with flexible titration to the optimal dose for each individual patient."}

Fifty-three patients received individualized therapeutic doses, delivering a specified total-body radiation dose (TBD) based on the clearance rate of a preceding dosimetric dose. Six patients received dosimetric doses only. Dose-escalations of TBD were conducted separately in patients who had or had not undergone a prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) until a nonmyeloablative maximally tolerated TBD was established (non-ASCT = 75 cGy, post-ASCT = 45 cGy). Fourteen additional non-ASCT patients were treated with 75 cGy. Unlabeled antibody was given prior to labeled dosimetric and therapeutic doses to improve biodistribution. Forty-two (71%) of 59 patients responded; 20 (34%) had complete responses (CR). Thirty-five (83%) of 42 with low-grade or transformed NHL responded versus 7 (41%) of 17 with de novo intermediate-grade NHL (P =.005). For all 42 responders, the median progression-free survival was 12 months, 20.3 for those with CR. Seven patients remain in CR 3 to 5.7 years. Sixteen patients were re-treated after progression; 9 responded and 5 had a CR. Reversible hematologic toxicity was dose limiting. Only 10 patients (17%) had human anti-mouse antibodies detected.

We performed a phase I/II trial of combination olaparib tablets and temozolomide (OT) in patients with previously treated SCLC. We established a recommended phase II dose of olaparib 200 mg orally twice daily with temozolomide 75 mg/m2 daily, both on days 1 to 7 of a 21-day cycle, and expanded to a total of 50 patients. The confirmed overall response rate was 41.7% (20/48 evaluable); median progression-free survival was 4.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.8-5.7]; and median overall survival was 8.5 months (95% CI, 5.1-11.3). Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from trial patients recapitulated clinical OT responses, enabling a 32-PDX coclinical trial. This revealed a correlation between low basal expression of inflammatory-response genes and cross-resistance to both OT and standard first-line chemotherapy (etoposide/platinum). These results demonstrate a promising new therapeutic strategy in SCLC and uncover a molecular signature of those tumors most likely to respond. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate substantial clinical activity of combination olaparib/temozolomide in relapsed SCLC, revealing a promising new therapeutic strategy for this highly recalcitrant malignancy. Through an integrated coclinical trial in PDXs, we then identify a molecular signature predictive of response to OT, and describe the common molecular features of cross-resistant SCLC.See related commentary by Pacheco and Byers, p. 1340.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1325."},

Preclinical studies have shown that uPAR can influence the state of phosphorylation and signalling activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a ligand-independent manner. The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether plasma soluble intact and cleaved uPAR(I-III)+(II-III) levels could identify a subpopulation of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) where treatment with cetuximab would have a beneficial effect. Plasma samples were available from 453 patients treated in the NORDIC VII study. Patients were randomized between FLOX and FLOX + cetuximab. The levels of uPAR(I-III)+(II-III) were determined by time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. We demonstrated that higher baseline plasma uPAR(I-III)+(II-III) levels were significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 1.30, 1.14-1.48, p = 0.0001) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.75, 1.52-2.02, p < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that plasma uPAR(I-III)+(II-III) was an independent biomarker of short OS (HR = 1.45, 1.20-1.75, p = 0.0001). There were no significant interactions between plasma uPAR(I-III)+(II-III) levels, KRAS mutational status and treatment either PFS (p = 0.43) or OS (p = 0.095). However, further explorative analyses indicated that patients with low levels of circulating suPAR and a KRAS wild-type tumor have improved effect from treatment with FLOX + cetuximab as compared to patients with KRAS wild-type and high levels of suPAR. These results thus support the preclinical findings and should be further tested in an independent clinical data set."}

Here we present data for the activity of afatinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer that have tumours harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations.In this post-hoc analysis, we used prospectively collected data from tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced (stage IIIb-IV) lung adenocarcinomas who were given afatinib in a single group phase 2 trial (LUX-Lung 2), and randomised phase 3 trials (LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6). Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, including all randomly assigned patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. The type of EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion [del19], Leu858Arg point mutation in exon 21, or other) and ethnic origin (LUX-Lung 3 only; Asian vs non-Asian) were pre-specified stratification factors in the randomised trials. We categorised all uncommon mutations as: point mutations or duplications in exons 18-21 (group 1); de-novo Thr790Met mutations in exon 20 alone or in combination with other mutations (group 2); or exon 20 insertions (group 3). We also assessed outcomes in patients with the most frequent uncommon mutations, Gly719Xaa, Leu861Gln, and Ser768Ile, alone or in combination with other mutations.

The levels of soluble mediators such as sIL-2R and sCD8 were also increased. Changes were noted as early as the GM-CSF treatment period, and were observed to a further extent during IL-2 treatment. In the present study, it was found that this sequential chemoimmunotherapy regimen consisting of 4 agents (DTIC, GM-CSF, IL-2, IFN-alpha) has acceptable toxicity, can be administered on an outpatient basis, results in increased numbers of activated T-lymphocytes, and induces activity against metastatic melanoma that warrants further investigation."},

All participants underwent a mandatory baseline biopsy, and optional biopsy specimens were obtained on treatment and at disease progression. Whole-exome sequencing, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for BRAF splicing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemical analysis were performed on tumor samples, and blood was analyzed for levels of circulating BRAF V600.The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were secondary clinical end points.A total of 28 patients were screened, and 23 enrolled. Among evaluable patients, the confirmed ORR was 10%; disease control rate (DCR) was 45%, and median PFS was 13 weeks. Clinical benefit was associated with duration of prior BRAFi therapy greater than 6 months (DCR, 73% vs 11% for ≤6 months; P = .02) and decrease in circulating BRAF V600 at day 8 of cycle 1 (DCR, 75% vs 18% for no decrease; P = .02) but not with pretreatment mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations or activation. Biopsy specimens obtained during treatment demonstrated that CombiDT therapy failed to achieve significant MAPK pathway inhibition or immune infiltration in most patients.The baseline presence of MAPK pathway alterations was not associated with benefit from CombiDT in patients with BRAFi-refractory metastatic melanoma. Failure to inhibit the MAPK pathway provides a likely explanation for the limited clinical benefit of CombiDT in this setting.

Unadjusted median OS and PFS (months) were significantly lower in black patients than in white patients (OS: black: 27.1, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 21.3-32.1; white: 37.3, 95 % CI 34.6-41.1; PFS: black: 7.0, 95 % CI 5.7-8.2; white: 10.2, 95 % CI 9.3-11.2). The adjusted OS hazard ratio (HR) for black patients compared with white patients was 1.29 (95 % CI 1.00-1.65); adjusted PFS HR was 1.29 (95 % CI 1.05-1.59). This real-world evaluation of a large cohort of patients with HER2-positive MBC shows poorer prognostic factors and independently worse clinical outcomes in black versus white patients. Further research is needed to identify potential biologic differences that could have predictive impact for black patients or that could explain these differences."}

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients are often treated with sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

Our aim with the current study was to assess annexin A1 (ANXA1), which stimulates angiogenesis, as a predictive marker for sunitinib therapy in mRCC patients. Since previous studies have indicated a predictive potential for cubilin, we also investigated the predictivity of ANXA1 combined with cubilin. Methods: ANXA1 expression was analysed in tumor tissue from a cohort of patients with advanced RCC (n=139) using immunohistochemistry. Ninety-nine of the patients were treated with sunitinib in the first or second-line setting. Twenty-two of these were censored because of toxicity leading to the termination of treatment and the remaining (n=77) were selected for the present study. Results: Twenty-five (32%) out of seventy-seven of the tumors lacked ANXA1 in the cytoplasm. On statistical analyses using Kaplan-Meier method, aNXA1 negative tumors were significantly associated with a longer treatment benefit in terms of progression free survival (PFS). Overall survival was also significantly better for patients with ANXA1 negative tumors. The combined ANXA1 positive and cubilin negative expression could more accurately than ANXA1 alone define the group not benefitting from treatment. Conclusions: Our results indicate that cytoplasmic expression of ANXA1 is a negative predictive marker for sunitinib therapy in mRCC patients. A possible explanation for this finding is that sunitinibs anti-angiogenic effect cannot overcome the pro-angiogenic drive from many ANXA1 proteins."},

The primary end-point was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in cycle 1. Safety was further evaluated as a secondary end-point; preliminary efficacy was also examined. Results: Two DLTs (grade 3 anemia requiring transfusion and grade 3 mucositis unresponsive to treatment within 4 days of onset) were observed in one of six patients enrolled in dose cohort 1. Cohort 1 was expanded from 6 to 12 patients to further evaluate safety, per the investigators' recommendation. All patients discontinued treatment. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were abdominal pain, fatigue, mucositis, and decreased neutrophil count. Objective response rate was 33% (four partial responses). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-11.3) and 9.9 (95% CI, 4.4-13.2) months, respectively; 1-year PFS and OS rates were 12.2% (95% CI, 0.7-40.8) and 38.9% (95% CI, 12.6-65.0). Conclusion: FABLOx is feasible and tolerable in patients newly diagnosed with MPC. However, preliminary efficacy data are inconclusive for continued investigation in a phase II trial."}

Materials and Methods The study was centrally approved by the ethics committee of three tertiary medical centers in China. From January 2010 to January 2015, 207 consecutive patients with advanced rHCC after initial hepatectomy received sorafenib combined with TACE-RFA (combination group, n = 106) or sorafenib alone (sorafenib group, n = 101) at the three medical centers. Overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) were compared between the two groups. Complications were assessed. Survival curves were constructed with the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared with the log-rank test. Results Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. No treatment-related death occurred in either group. The toxicity profile in the combination group was similar to that in the sorafenib group. After treatment, median OS (14.0 vs 9.0 months, respectively; P < .001) and TTP (7.0 vs 4.0 months, respectively; P < .001) were significantly longer in the combination group than in the sorafenib group. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment allocation was a significant predictor of OS and TTP, while the number of intrahepatic tumors was another prognostic factor of OS.

Current recommendations for incurable disease consist of a platinum-based regimen with fluorouracil and cetuximab. Studied in patients with PS of 0 to 1, the fluorouracil-based regimens were associated with significant toxicities. Therefore, weekly PCC may offer an appealing, less toxic alternative for incurable patients with poor PS.

Median OS was 23.3 months (95% CI, 19.5 to 29.6 months) with T-VEC and 18.9 months (95% CI, 16.0 to 23.7 months) with GM-CSF (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.00; P = .051). T-VEC efficacy was most pronounced in patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a disease and in patients with treatment-naive disease. The most common adverse events (AEs) with T-VEC were fatigue, chills, and pyrexia. The only grade 3 or 4 AE occurring in ≥ 2% of T-VEC-treated patients was cellulitis (2.1%). No fatal treatment-related AEs occurred.T-VEC is the first oncolytic immunotherapy to demonstrate therapeutic benefit against melanoma in a phase III clinical trial. T-VEC was well tolerated and resulted in a higher DRR (P < .001) and longer median OS (P = .051), particularly in untreated patients or those with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a disease. T-VEC represents a novel potential therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma."}

In preclinical models tumour-derived VEGF limits immune cell activity while anti-VEGF augments intra-tumoral T-cell infiltration, potentially through vascular normalization and endothelial cell activation. This study investigates how VEGF blockade with bevacizumab could potentiate PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition with atezolizumab in mRCC. Tissue collections are before treatment, after bevacizumab and after the addition of atezolizumab. We discover that intra-tumoral CD8(+) T cells increase following combination treatment. A related increase is found in intra-tumoral MHC-I, Th1 and T-effector markers, and chemokines, most notably CX3CL1 (fractalkine). We also discover that the fractalkine receptor increases on peripheral CD8(+) T cells with treatment. Furthermore, trafficking lymphocyte increases are observed in tumors following bevacizumab and combination treatment. These data suggest that the anti-VEGF and anti-PD-L1 combination improves antigen-specific T-cell migration."},

However, in order to debulk and change the local immunosuppressive environment of tumors that cannot be injected directly, oncolyitc viruses need to be administered systemically. Among different viruses, adenovirus has been extensively used in clinical trials but with few evidences of activity upon systemic administration. Preclinical efficacy of a single intravenous administration of our oncolytic adenovirus ICOVIR5, an adenovirus type 5 responsive to the retinoblastoma pathway commonly deregulated in tumors, led us to use this virus in a dose-escalation phase 1 trial in metastatic melanoma patients.
