249	2960	-1	CC-220-MM-001 is a phase 1/2 study evaluating dose escalations of IBER with different treatment combinations in independent cohorts, in patients (pts) with RRMM (NCT02773030); the IBER + DEX cohort showed a favorable safety profile with promising efficacy and a selected IBER RP2D of 1.6 mg 21/28 days (D).	137710	4
250	2960	-1	Introduction: Iberdomide (IBER; CC-220) is a potent, novel cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase modulator (CELMoD) agent under investigation in a phase 1/2 dose-escalation study in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) (CC-220-MM-001; NCT02773030).	137667	4
251	2961	-101	Cellular potencies of PHI-101 have also been assessed using various patient-derived AML cells as well as MV4-11, MOLM14 and BaF3 cell lines transformed with human FLT3 mutants including single mutations [FLT3(ITD), FLT3(D835Y)], double or triple mutations [FLT3(ITD/D835Y), FLT3(ITD/F691L), FLT3(ITD/F691L/D835Y)].	139044	4
252	2962	-112	Moreover, PT-112 was highly active in the orthotopic, immune-competent Vk*MYC mouse model of multiple myeloma, including drug-resistant transplant variants.	134916	4

264	2974	-8226	This was further confirmed in a mouse intradermal RPMI-8226 xenograft tumor model, in which infusion of BCMA2 T-cells resulted in the rapid and complete eradication of tumors, while BCMA1 showed a slower decline in tumor burden.\\n	141062	4
265	2975	-9	To facilitate selective ex vivo and in vivo expansion of engineered T cells we have developed a human orthogonal (ortho) ligand/receptor system consisting of a pegylated, IL-2 mutein (STK- 009) that does not significantly activate the wild type receptor and a mutated IL-2 Receptor Beta (orthoIL-2Rβ) that does not significantly respond to its native ligand, wild type IL-2.	143483	4
266	2976	-ann	Conclusion: This study demonstrated vastly higher efficacy of the L-ANN/ARA-C combination (ANNARAC) over that of the single agents in an immune-competent setting of an aggressive, p53-null AML model.	143344	4

290	2995	18f-fdg	ConclusionCombining quantitative radiomics features extracted from baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT scans with components of the IPI score significantly improved identification of patients at risk of relapse at baseline.	137412	4
291	2995	18f-fdg	Fluoro-desoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is also a validated procedure for the imaging of MM bone lesions and the evaluation of extramedullary plasmacytoma.	136185	4
292	2995	18f-fdg	Background: 18F-FDG-PET/CT is currently the standard technique to define imaging-minimal residual disease (MRD) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.	139363	4
293	2996	18f-fluorodeoxyglucose	On Study Day 29, the patient’s tumor response assessment showed partial response by Lugano 2014 criteria, with a greater than 70% decrease in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and greater than 50% reduction in tumor size.	141777	4
294	2996	18f-fluorodeoxyglucose	Even though metabolic tumor burden assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has a confirmed prognostic value in the setting of chemoimmunotherapy, its predictive role after CAR T-cell therapy is not established.\\n\\n	134737	4
295	2996	18f-fluorodeoxyglucose	The model was based on a real-world cohort of early-stage FL patients, staged using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography,from the Australasian Lymphoma Alliance.	138590	4

298	2998	2-deoxy-d-glucose	To assess the necessity of the diminished glycolytic activity we treated PDH knockout and devimistat treated cells with the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose.	142618	4
299	2998	2-deoxy-d-glucose	Extracellular acidification rate, an indicator of glycolytic activity, was monitored under basal conditions followed by sequential treatment with glucose, oligomycin, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (a competitive inhibitor of glucose).	136229	4
300	2998	2-deoxy-d-glucose	Remarkably, OXPHOS inhibition by electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors (rotenone, antimycin A and oligomycin) counteracted strongly for VEN resistance, while glycolysis inhibition by 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) did not.	139982	4
301	2999	2599023	ConclusionsBAY 2599023 has a broad patient eligibility due to low seroprevalence and low titers of pre-existing Nabs against AAVhu37 compared with other AAVs.	139803	4
302	3000	28z1xx	Study Design and Methods: This study is a single center Phase I clinical trial of 19(T2)28z1XX in patients with R/R B-cell malignancies at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NCT04464200).	143088	4
303	3001	5-ht3	Introduction: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common and distressing side effect that has a detrimental impact on QoL. For pts receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC), which includes those on anthracycline-cyclophosphamide (AC)-based regimens, a triple combination of a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1 RA), a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) RA and dexamethasone is recommended by the NCCN and MASCC/ESMO.	135916	4
304	3002	58fe	Methods: In this prospective experimental multi-center case-control study (normal-weight (NW) n=40; OWOB n=37) we administered labeled [57Fe]- or [58Fe]-FeSO4 to women during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy.	139453	4
305	3003	8-cl	Thus, our data suggest that the synergy seen in AML with the VEN plus 8-Cl-Ado combination can be explained at least in part due to augmented inhibition of FAO and OXPHOS and represents a promising novel treatment for AML.	143240	4
306	3004	8430	Finally, downstream targets such as Slc2a1, Cdk2, and Cyclina2 were decreased in 8430-treated CALM-AF10 leukemia cells.	140754	4
307	3005	89zr-	The DFO-ICOS mAb conjugate was radiolabeled with 37 MBq (~1 mCi) of 89Zr-oxalate (final specific activity 6 µCi/µg/ml and radiochemical purity of 99%).	136331	4
308	3006	ab023	This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of AB023 in patients with ESRD on chronic HD.\\n	139948	4
309	3007	abvd	ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) or ABVD-like therapy (AVD or modified ABVD dose/regimen) was the most common primary HL therapy, used in 65% (20/31).	136056	4
310	3007	abvd	The standard initial tx for adults with advanced stage HL, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), is associated with pulmonary toxicity due to bleomycin.	137089	4
311	3007	abvd	Among the patients with an advanced stage disease, ABVD was the dominant frontline regimen, accounting for 79% of treated HL cases, followed by ABVD-like regimens (15%), and BEACOPP (3%).	140624	4
312	3007	abvd	Chemotherapy using ABVD (Adriamycin Bleomycin Vinblastine Dacarbazine) is the standard of care in most centers for the management of adult CHL.	140534	4
313	3007	abvd	Introduction: In the phase 3 ECHELON-1 study (NCT01712490), treatment with brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (A+AVD) significantly improved modified progression-free survival in patients with newly-diagnosed stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) compared with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD).	140698	4
314	3007	abvd	The median age of patients receiving ABVD/ABVD-like regimen was 34 years, and 62% were male.	136338	4
315	3007	abvd	23% of the patients receiving the ABVD therapy had an event compared to 3.3% of the patients in the EURONET treatment group.	141183	4
316	3007	abvd	This may be in part due to the older age of HvRT diagnosis, which limits the ability to give curative therapy with ABVD.	142276	4
317	3007	abvd	Newly diagnosed patients are treated with combinations of chemotherapeutics, the most common of which includes adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD).	141186	4
318	3007	abvd	Introduction: Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend one of three frontline (1L) regimens to treat stage III or IV classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL): doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD), or bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (escalated (e) dose-BEACOPP).	136422	4
319	3008	abvd regimen	In this open label multicenter study, chemo-naïve Hodgkin’s Lymphoma patients who were addressed to receive their first cycle of ABVD regimen (2 doses in 28 days, on days 1 and 15) were given a single administration of NEPA plus 4 mg dexamethasone.	139297	4
320	3009	ace2	It is well established that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells after binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and utilizes a spike protein (S) for attachment and entry into the cells, leading to their lysis or damage.	137083	4
321	3010	acetyl	Based on growth and survival impact of RROL depletion, we performed integrated transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq data after RROL depletion in MM cell lines and CD138+ patient MM cells, and identified a set of significantly modulated metabolic genes including the acetyl Co-A Carboxylase 1 (ACC1) gene, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme of the DNL pathway.	142514	4

370	3030	amyloid	Background: Systemic AL amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils produced by light chains synthesized by clonal CD38+ plasma cells.	139323	4
371	3030	amyloid	It is hypothesized that CAEL-101 will modify the disease course of AL amyloidosis by facilitating the removal of amyloid fibrils deposited in tissues.	143307	4
372	3030	amyloid	Introduction\\nImmunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia producing monoclonal light chains that misfold and form amyloid fibrils which can deposit in a variety of tissues and organs.	138500	4
373	3031	amyloidosis	Median baseline suPAR levels were 6.6 ng/mL (range 2.7-29.0 ng/mL), which is significantly higher than in other studies in non-amyloidosis patients with CKD or CAD/CHF (median 3.04-3.7 ng/ml).	136774	4
374	3032	androgen	The presence of clonal hematopoiesis, analyzed using genomic DNA purified from granulocytes of peripheral blood from female patients in a human androgen receptor assay, revealed that only 1 out of 15 patients was clonal.	134494	4
375	3033	angiotensin 1-7	This activation was inhibited by exposure of the stimulated cells to angiotensin 1-7 or CoPP.	137083	4
376	3034	angiotensin ii	Based on our findings, CFZ-induced cardiotoxicity may be prevented or mitigated by either blocking RAS activation at the angiotensin II receptor level using selective drugs like Valsartan, or by reducing angiotensin levels with atRA.	139277	4
377	3035	angiotensin-converting enzyme 2	It is well established that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells after binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and utilizes a spike protein (S) for attachment and entry into the cells, leading to their lysis or damage.	137083	4

381	3037	anthracyclines	Briefly, the odd cycles of mini-hyper-CVD (cycles 1, 3, 5, 7) comprised cyclophosphamide (150 mg/m2 every 12 h on days 1-3), vincristine (2 mg flat dose on days 1 and 8), and dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1-4 and days 11-14) without anthracyclines.	141711	4
382	3037	anthracyclines	Selinexor induces retention of topoisomerase II in the nucleus increasing sensitivity to anthracyclines.	137032	4
383	3037	anthracyclines	Induction therapy for AML with cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, ARA-C) is routinely used in combinations with anthracyclines.\\n	135947	4

385	3037	anthracyclines	The mini-hyper-CVD (cycles 1, 3, 5, 7) were comprised of cyclophosphamide (150 mg/m2 every 12 h on days 1-3), vincristine (2 mg flat dose on days 1 and 8), and dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1-4 and days 11-14) without anthracyclines.	143426	4
386	3037	anthracyclines	In the 496 survivors that received chemotherapy only, the incidence of CV disease at 15 y was 4.6% vs 2.3% in controls, and those that received anthracyclines and mediastinal RT had significantly higher incidence at 8.6% (Figure B).	139896	4
387	3037	anthracyclines	Anthracyclines constitute an essential component of induction chemotherapy for AML patients, however owing in part to the cardiotoxicity concerns, they are not broadly prescribed in R/R AML settings.	141752	4
388	3037	anthracyclines	Unlike conventional anthracyclines, ANN accumulates in multidrug resistant cell lines, inducing DNA damage and apoptosis.	139999	4
389	3037	anthracyclines	We hypothesized that the optimal time to administer sorafenib would be d4-10 of induction in order to limit overlap with anthracyclines on d1-3 and to avoid high FLT3 ligand (FLT3L) levels beyond d10, which could abrogate FLT3 on-target activity and diminish the therapeutic index.	143344	4
390	3037	anthracyclines	Selinexor sensitizes AML cells to anthracyclines by retaining topoisomerase II in the nucleus resulting in increased DNA strand breaks.	136454	4

397	3042	antihistamine	Antihistamine and paracetamol premedication was given.	136061	4
398	3043	antihistamines	Premedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids, as well as decreasing the pegaspargase infusion rate have been proposed as approaches to reduce hypersensitivity reactions (Cooper 2019, Bade 2019, Stock 2019).	140800	4
399	3043	antihistamines	The European Myeloma Network recommends topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for localized skin reactions.	134749	4
400	3043	antihistamines	Conclusions\\nPremedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids or prolongation of infusion time did not affect the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to PEG over a three-year period at our institution.	143248	4
401	3044	antiplatelet	These variables included age, sex, obesity (BMI>30), race/ethnicity, performance status, comorbidities, blood type, history of VTE, recent surgery, recent anti-cancer therapy, cancer subtype VTE risk grouping (adapted from Khorana Score), pre-admission anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, and ICU admission status.\\n	139229	4
402	3044	antiplatelet	Concomitant therapies included antiplatelet agents (31%) and cytoreductive drugs in 90% (hydroxyurea in 87%of cases).	138834	4
403	3045	antiplatelets	Despite this, our findings do not suggest a clinical benefit of chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelets in mitigating disease severity in COVID-19 patients	134254	4

408	3049	arsenic	We have reported that a brief pretreatment with low dose arsenic (LDA), by temporarily and reversibly downregulating p53 at the time of treatment with DDA, reduces the normal tissue toxicity without compromising tumor response to treatment.	139137	4
409	3050	arv-	BET inhibitor OTX015 and BET protein degrader ARV-771 induced more lethality in HPRT1, compared to HPRT3 and HPRT2 cells, which correlated with higher levels of BRD4, c-Myc and TCF4, but markedly lower levels of IRF4 in HPRT1 cells.	138637	4
410	3051	asct	Given the treatment-related toxicities associated with ASCT and the expanding novel therapeutic options, it is desirable to identify pts with RR disease who may be cured by less toxic treatment approaches.	142701	4

418	3053	asparaginase	These regimens, which rely heavily on corticosteroids and asparaginase (asp), are known to increase the risk of osteonecrosis (ON).	143248	4
419	3053	asparaginase	Introduction: Asparaginase is a key component in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the treatment is jeopardized by 20% or more developing asparaginase-associated toxicities (asp-tox), mostly hypersensitivity, osteonecrosis, pancreatitis and thromboembolism (Albertsen et al 2019).	136920	4
420	3053	asparaginase	Introduction\\nPegaspargase (PEG) is a critical component of therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, complete asparaginase treatment may be hampered by the development of hypersensitivity reactions.	137488	4
421	3053	asparaginase	Eryaspase (150 U/kg) is scheduled to complete the intended course of asparaginase (1-7 doses).  	139392	4

551	3314	cytosine	TET2 belongs to a 3 member family of TET dioxygenases that catalyze DNA demethylation by oxidation of 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-hmC) and further oxidative cytosine products.	139329	4
552	3314	cytosine	A diffuse hypermethylated status is the biological consequence of the R-2HG-mediated inhibition of several α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent enzymes including DNA dioxygenases TET1, TET2 and TET3.1,2 Specifically, the inhibition of TET2, either induced by the interaction with R-2HG or by direct genomic silencing (as in case of TET2 loss of function mutations) is responsible for the block of the DNA cytosine demethylation pathway, inducing changes in expression patterns, (e.g. decreasing expression of tumor suppressor genes) and impairing execution of differentiation programs.	143335	4
553	3314	cytosine	The frequency of cytosine-to-thymine (C→T) transition was significantly higher in TET2ancestral subjects compared with TET2subclonal subjects (P=0.029), which was considered to be a somatic mutational signature of aging, indicating that MDS driven by TET2ancestral was likely derived from TET2MT ARCH.	140528	4
554	3314	cytosine	Azacitidine is a cytosine analogue which acts to inhibit DNA methylation, and venetoclax is a potent Bcl-2 inhibitor.	143094	4

823	3495	stimulating agents	MDS directed treatment included azacitidine (8) (2 with venetoclax), erythropoietin stimulating agents (3), best-supportive care (4), intravenous immunoglobulin (3), and lenalidomide (1).	138969	4
824	3496	succinate	In line with these data, automatic docking of P-Et inside the SDH catalytic domain confirmed that P-Et can occupy the succinate binding site in an energetically favorable conformation, mimicking succinate.	143852	4
825	3496	succinate	To gain insight into the specific mechanism by which P-Et could repress complex II, we analyzed its activity in competition assays in presence of both P-Et and increasing concentration of succinate, the endogenous substrate of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), showing that succinate supplementation was able to restore the normal SDH activity starting from 50µM. Taken globally, these data suggest that P-Et acts as a competitive inhibitor of succinate for SDH activity.	135858	4
826	3497	sulfamethoxazole	PJP ppx (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) was associated with fewer bacterial infections (OR 0.44 p=0.003) but did not reduce the incidence of FN (OR 0.83 p=0.63).	138642	4

870	3532	uridine	To confirm that PTC299 effects are due to inhibition of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis for leukemic growth, we specifically tested the impact of uridine and orotate rescue.	139940	4
871	3532	uridine	To see if this effect of Ven can counter Dec/5Aza resistance, we selected for THP1 AML cells double-resistant to Dec 0.5 μM and 5Aza 5 μM – these cells upregulated expression of de novo pyrimidine synthesis enzymes and contained uridine, cytidine and deoxycytidine at levels up to 7-fold higher than parental cells.	143200	4
872	3533	ursodiol	The mean peak plasminogen activator inhibitor type one (PAI- 1) level was significantly lower in the rTM group vs heparin and ursodiol group (P = 0.04), and the mean peak activated protein C (APC) level was significantly higher in the rTM group (P = 0.01) (Yamamoto et al).	142237	4

1101	4043	thiopurine	Further, experimental thiopurine treatment was able to directly induce TP53 R248Q variants in MMR-deficient cultured cells, including Nalm6 and MCF10A MSH2-/-, by activating the thio-dMMR mutational signature, while MMR-proficient MCF10A cells did not experience R248Q induction.	1422	10
1102	4044	thio-dmmr	Using isogenic MCF10A cells with or without engineered MSH2 knockout, and the Nalm6 ALL cell line which has native MMR deficiency, we found that this novel signature was caused by a synergistic mutagenic interaction between thiopurine treatment and mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency (called the thio-dMMR signature) that contributes to a hypermutator phenotype and acquisition of TP53 R248Q in residual ALL during remission.	1422	10
1103	4045	thiopurines	Indeed, thiopurines preferentially induced C>T mutations at the center of NCG trinucleotides, which can lead to TP53 R248Q, and the thiopurine mutation rate was accelerated 2- to 10-fold in MMR-deficient ALL and cell lines.	1422	10
